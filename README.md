# Open-Smartwatch Sleek-Case 3D Files
Sleeker design made to be as compact and "watch like" as possible

Fits with 1.6mm light pcb and round battery
The battery and pcb need to be spaced using a round plastic piece cut from your usual transparent electronics packaging, should be around 0.3mm thick and same diameter as the pcb with a small cutout or flat spot for the battery wires.
The case requires 4 6mm M1.4 hex screws.

There will most likely be some sanding of the button's back face required for them to fit snugly and also not keep the button depressed. 30 seconds on 600 grit sandpaper should work

Compatible with any standard 20mm watch band.
