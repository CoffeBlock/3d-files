AVATA WATCH CASE V0.1.1-dev
---------------------------

3 versions of avata watch case.
	1. Avata no glass whas made for prototype .
	2. Avata glass is the final.
	3. Avata glass is the final. (beta)
	
To get the best results on 3d printing you have tou use PETG material with the smallest nozzle available (0.25mm).
 
You need a 22mm wrist band, 
Plexyglass metrics are 1 x 39 mm (thickness x dia).

Pay atention on the wrist strap pins, the hole is only 1mm deep and can easy snap off in a short time. This hole must be filled with a 1mm tube. 
 
For any questions see the p3dt discord channel #avata-stl or contact me on instagram @techno_turk.
 
Future plans can be added on later version:
 
 * battery cover.
 * buttons.
 * sensor holes.
 * speaker hole.
 * usb hole.
 * waterproof gasket (optional chellange) :).
