# Open-Smartwatch Sleek-Case 3D Files
Sleeker design made to be as compact and "watch like" as possible

Fits with 1.6mm light pcb and round battery
The battery and pcb need to be spaced using a round plastic piece cut from your usual transparent electronics packaging, should be around 0.3mm thick and same diameter as the pcb with a small cutout or flat spot for the battery wires.
The case requires 4 6mm M1.4 hex screws.
